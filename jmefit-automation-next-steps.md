**Current Recommendation:** Free Transformation Bundle including:
- Custom macro calculation (worth $99)
- 7-day meal planning template
- Beginner workout video series  
- Private community access

**Your Decision Needed:**
- Do you have these resources ready to deliver?
- What other lead magnets could we create? (workout PDFs, nutrition guides, etc.)
- Should we create different lead magnets for different segments?

### **2. Email Platform Integration**
**Question:** What email service do you want to use for sending?

**Options:**
- **SendGrid** (recommended for deliverability)
- **Mailgun** (developer-friendly)
- **Direct SMTP** through your current provider
- **ConvertKit/ActiveCampaign** (if you prefer established marketing platforms)

**Technical Requirements:**
- SMTP credentials for n8n integration
- Domain authentication for better deliverability
- Email template hosting

### **3. Social Media Data Collection**
**Question:** How comfortable are you with collecting social media data for ICP scoring?

**Current Plan:** When users sign up with Google/Facebook, we collect:
- Profile information (age, location)
- Instagram follower count and fitness post frequency
- Facebook interests and activity data

**Your Decision:**
- Are you comfortable with this level of data collection?
- Do you have Instagram/Facebook developer accounts set up?
- Should we limit data collection for privacy concerns?

### **4. Database Implementation**
**Question:** Do you want me to run the database schema migration on your Supabase instance?

**What's Needed:**
- Access to your Supabase project (or I can guide you through it)
- Running the SQL schema file to create new tables
- Setting up proper permissions and indexes

**Timeline:** 30 minutes to implement and test

### **5. n8n Hosting**
**Question:** Where do you want to host the n8n automation workflow?

**Options:**
- **n8n Cloud** (easiest, ~$50/month)
- **Self-hosted** on your existing infrastructure
- **Docker container** on a VPS
- **Netlify Functions** integration

**My Recommendation:** Start with n8n Cloud for reliability, then migrate if needed.

### **6. Quiz Integration**
**Question:** Where should we place the fitness assessment quiz?

**Current Plan:** Create `/quiz` page that:
- Collects goals, experience level, age, budget preferences
- Calculates initial ICP score
- Triggers appropriate email sequence
- Integrates with social login data

**Your Decision:**
- Should this be the primary lead capture method?
- Do you want multiple quiz versions for different traffic sources?
